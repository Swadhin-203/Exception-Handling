    "Q1. What isan Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and syntax errors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:An exception in Python is an error that occurs during program execution. When the interpreter encounters an exceptional condition, such as a division by zero or an invalid file operation, it raises an exception. This stops the normal flow of the program and transfers control to a special code block called an exception handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of exceptions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors: These occur when the code is not written according to the syntax rules of the language. They are detected by the interpreter before the program is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Runtime errors: These occur during program execution, when something unexpected happens that prevents the program from continuing. Examples include division by zero, accessing a non-existent index of a list, or trying to open a file that doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical errors: These occur when the program runs without any errors, but produces incorrect results. They are caused by a flaw in the logic of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors are detected by the interpreter before the program is run, while exceptions occur during program execution. The difference between exceptions and logical errors is that exceptions are caused by exceptional conditions, while logical errors are caused by flaws in the program's logic."

    "A. try and else are control flow statements in Python that allow you to handle exceptions in your code. The try block is used to wrap a section of code that might raise an exception. If an exception is raised, the code in the try block stops executing, and Python jumpswhether an exception was raised or not, the finally block will always be executed and the file.close() statement will close the file.\n",
